## What’s The Grim Syndicate?

10,000 generative NFTs on the #Solana blockchain.

> The Grim Syndicate are an elite collective responsible for ferrying fickle Souls from across the dimensional spectrum (even those hard-to-reach pocket universes) to arrive at their final destination. At the Ethereal Transit Authority death doesn't have to mean a dead-end. -- https://grimsyndicate.com/
